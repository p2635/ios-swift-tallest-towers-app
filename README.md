# Tallest Towers App

- Simple app that shows a list of tallest towers and a details page for each.
- This forked project originally included both unit and UI tests.
- My goal with this fork is simply to practise writing tests. I deleted them so I can practise writing them from scratch.
- To run all tests locally, choose "Test" from the "Product" menu or press âŒ˜U.
- Semaphore created [the original repo](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ios-swift-xcode), the Tallest Towers app is used to showcase their CI/CD product (which I'm not interested in at the moment).

## Todo

- [ ] Write down what each unit and UI test does (in plain English)
- [ ] Delete the original unit and UI tests
- [ ] Re-implement those tests (without looking)
- [ ] Compare your answers to the original solutions
