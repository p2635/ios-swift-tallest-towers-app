# Tallest Towers App

I forked this from [this repo](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ios-swift-xcode) created by Semaphore, they created this test app to showcase their product. I'm not interested to learn about their CI/CD product (at the moment), I merely forked to to practise writing tests for the first time.

This project originally included both unit, and UI tests, but I deleted them so I can practise writing them from scratch. To run all tests locally, choose "Test" from the "Product" menu or press âŒ˜U.
