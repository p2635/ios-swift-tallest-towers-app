# Tallest Towers App

- Simple app that shows a list of tallest towers and a details page for each.
- This forked project originally included both unit and UI tests.
- My goal with this fork is simply to practise writing tests. I deleted them so I can practise writing them from scratch.
- To run all tests locally, choose "Test" from the "Product" menu or press âŒ˜U.
- Semaphore created [the original repo](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ios-swift-xcode), the Tallest Towers app is used to showcase their CI/CD product (which I'm not interested in at the moment).

## Todo

- [x] Write down what each unit and UI test does (in plain English)
- [x] Delete the original unit and UI tests (apart from the import statements) - Ouch!
- [ ] Re-implement those tests (without looking)
- [ ] Compare your answers to the original solutions

## The tests

Reimplement these tests:

**Unit Tests**

- [ ] Create a test case called 'TowerInstanceTests'
    - [ ] Create a a setup function. It should create a test variable to store a dummy tower, use the implicit unwrapped optional. 
    - [ ] 'testLocationShouldBeCreatedFromLatitudeAndLongitudeProperties' - check you can access the location's latitude and longitude for a Tower instance. Pay attention to accuracy.
    - [ ] 'testCityAndCountryShouldConcatenateCityAndCountry' - self-evident.
    - [ ] 'testFormattedHeightIncludesUnits' - self-evident.
- [ ] Create a test case called 'TowerStaticTests'
    - [ ] 'testTallestTowersShouldNotBeEmpty' - self-evident.

**UI Tests**

- [ ] Create a test case called 'TallestTowersUITests'
- [ ] Set up the app to launch
- [ ] Check that 'Burj Khalifa' exists in the list and tap on it 
- [ ] Check that 'Shanghai Tower' exists in the list and tap on it 
- [ ] Tap on a tower entry and check the details match that tower
